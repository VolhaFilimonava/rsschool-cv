## About Myself
I started my career as a researcher at the Museum of Belarusian Book-Printing 12 years ago and to this point in time I have become profficient and tried all possible activities in this field. For now I can't see possibilities for personal growth in profession so it's time to change the field of activity.

Programming is a promising area that provides endless opportunities for self-development.
